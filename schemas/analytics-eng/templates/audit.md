## Methodology Assessment

<!-- Is the approach appropriate for the question? -->

### Appropriateness
<!-- Is this the right analytical approach for the question asked? -->

### Statistical Validity
<!-- Are statistical methods correctly applied? Sample sizes adequate? -->

### Reproducibility
<!-- Can someone else reproduce these results with the provided queries? -->

## Bias Checklist

<!-- Check for common analytical biases -->

- [ ] **Survivorship Bias**: Are we only looking at "survivors"? Missing churned users, failed transactions, etc.?
- [ ] **Selection Bias**: Is the sample representative? Any systematic exclusions?
- [ ] **Confirmation Bias**: Did we look for evidence that contradicts our hypothesis?
- [ ] **Time Period**: Is the time period representative? Seasonality considered?
- [ ] **Outliers**: Are outliers appropriately handled? Neither ignored nor unduly influential?
- [ ] **Simpson's Paradox**: Do aggregate trends hold when segmented?
- [ ] **Correlation vs Causation**: Are causal claims supported by the methodology?
